# Project1 in Advanced computer architecture

This project implement a simulator of a simple out-of-order processor called OoO470. The processor runs a minimal subset of the RISC-V instruction set and is implemented with internal data structures similar to the MIPS R10000.
The simulator updates the status of the following hardware components:
